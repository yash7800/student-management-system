# Simple Student Management System

A basic console-based application built in C++ for managing student records. This project demonstrates the use of **structs**, **file handling**, **arrays**, and **pointers** to implement a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for student data.

---

## Features

- **Add New Student**: Add student records with details such as name, ID, and grade.
- **View All Students**: Display a list of all student records saved in the system.
- **Update Student Information**: Modify existing student details by searching for their ID.
- **Delete Student Record**: Remove a student record from the system.
- **Data Persistence**: Records are saved to a file (`student_records.txt`) and loaded automatically when the program starts.

---

## Skills Covered

- **Structs**: Organize and store student details (name, ID, grade) in a structured format.
- **File I/O**: Save and load student data using text files for persistence.
- **Dynamic Data Management**: Use vectors for dynamic storage of records.
- **Pointers and Arrays**: Handle operations efficiently with fundamental programming constructs.
